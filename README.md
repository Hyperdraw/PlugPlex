# PlugPlex
**_This project is in early development_**

PlugPlex is a simple system for web browser plugins. Plugins are no longer supported
most modern browsers, but sometimes it is necessary to bring platform native features
into javascript for web pages. With PlugPlex, you can install .NET assemblies as web plugins
that are shared between browsers and bring powerful features to the internet.
