# PlugPlex
**_This project is in early development_**

PlugPlex is a simple system for web browser plugins. Plugins are no longer supported
most modern browsers, but sometimes it is necessary to bring platform native features
into javascript for web pages. With PlugPlex, you can install .NET assemblies as web plugins
that are shared between browsers and bring powerful features to the internet.

## Building

To build PlugPlex, you will need Visual Studio 2017. Simply clone or download this repository
and build the solution in Visual Studio. The files will be output to PlugPlex/bin.
