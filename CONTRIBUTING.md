# Contributing to PlugPlex

So you want to contribute to the development of the PlugPlex project? Great.
As always, start by making a fork of the repository and cloning your fork locally.
Be sure to make changes **only to the _dev_ branch**! Contributions that directly edit
the master branch will not be accepted.
Here are some of the ways you can help...

## Writing Code

Of course, the most helpful thing you can do is to *write code*. Whether it's fixing
a bug or adding a feature, there's always work to be done. Befor submitting a pull request,
make sure that your code **has no syntax errors**, and can compile correctly. An easy way to get started
is to look for bug reports in the [issues section](https://github.com/HyperDraw/PlugPlex/issues).

## Documentation

Developers would be a lot happier if they knew what they were doing. There is always a need for
**documentation of how to write plugs**!

## Make Plugs

Although this isn't directly contributing to PlugPlex, it helps extend the functionality of browsers, which is out goal.

# And when you're done...

Commit your changes, push them to your fork, and start a pull request.
Be sure to explain the changes you've made and how to use them.
