As always, start by making a fork of the repository and cloning your fork locally.
Here are some of the ways you can help...

## Writing Code

Of course, the most helpful thing you can do is to *write code*. Whether it's fixing
a bug or adding a feature, there's always work to be done.

## Documentation

Developers would be a lot happier if they knew what they were doing. There is always a need for
**documentation of how to write plugs**!
